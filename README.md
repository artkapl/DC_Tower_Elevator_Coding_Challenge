# DC Tower Elevator Challenge

My implementation of the DC Tower Elevator Challenge using Java Threads and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Usage

This project was compiled using `JDK 17.0.2 2022-01-18 LTS`. Please ensure you have version 17.0.2 or higher installed to run this program.

To start the application you can either 
- run `DC_Tower_Elevator_Coding_Challenge.jar` using the following command:
  - `java -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8" -jar DC_Tower_Elevator_Coding_Challenge.jar`
- or directly run the `main()` method within src/Main.java

Note: Since the command line output text is in German, `-Dfile.encoding="UTF-8"` is used to accurately render any non-unicode characters.
